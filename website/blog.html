			<div id="text"><p>We officialy finished the game Vroom Boom, and presented it a few days ago to our IT teachers.
			Their feedbacks were pretty good, even if they noticed some features that were missing, and some improvements that
			we could have make. As a team, we are very proud of the final state of the game, but I personnaly think we could have
			done something better.</br></br>
			That is the reason why I will not stop working on the project. I already started to improve some features that
			we implemented a long time ago, like the car driving system, but without all the preasure and the requirements
			of the EPITA's S2 project. I hope that I will be able to show you some previews of my work soon.</br></br>
			By the way, the final version we presented to the jury is avalaible for free in our Download Section. Don't hesistate
			and go check it out !</br>
			I hope to show you some more stuff very soon. </br></br>

			<div id="pic"><img id="img" src="images/vb.jpg"></div>
			<div id="text"><p>
			Our incredible team is still really focused on the project, knowing that we have to present a new version of
			the project next Monday. But we wanted to share with you all the amazing stuff we worked on those past weeks.
			This post will be a perfect occasion for you to learn more about our team and who is working on Vroom Boom. I hope 
			you will enjoy it !
			</br></br></p>
			<h2>Thibaut 'ThibThib' Mattenet - Project Leader</h2>
			
			<p id="question">Hi Thibthib, could you present yourself a little bit ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">Hello guys ! I am Thibthib, 20 years old, and a little bit immature *laugh*</p>
			<p id="question">What are you doing in the development of Vroom Boom ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">I am responsible of the level design and team management. I really want our players to enjoy
			playing on the game, and I truly think that playing on beautiful maps is a very important element for players. I also need to study the gameplay, so that our maps
			are perfectly adjusted to our gameplay, and players can do amazing stuff on those maps.</p>
			<p id="question">Okay ! And what is your main inspiration when you create your maps ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">Mmm... That is a really good question ! I think I am mainly influenced by Mario Kart, because it is one of my favourite games, especially the Mario
			Kart : Double Dash, on GameCube. This one was absolutely amazing ! I think all the ballons or sun fight maps are really appropriate to our kind of gameplay, so 
			yeah, I guess this is my main inspiration.</p>
			<p id="question">What do you expect of Vroom Boom ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">I know it might seems a little bit exagerated, but I would love to see the game on Steam Greenlight, and of course greenlighted by the community. And
			my secret fantasy is to see Vroom Boom rewared Game of the Year, like my favourite game ever, Rocket League (After Vroom Boom of course).</p>
			<p id="question">Perfect ! Let's hope it will happen ! A last word for all your fans ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">Keep supporting us, and we hope we will do a great job and that we won't disapoint you. We are always listening to you and we want your feedbacks and
			your ideas !</p>
			</br>
			
			<h2>Alexandre 'Tofuzinzin' Girard - Art Director / Sound Designer</h2>
			
			<p id="question">Hello Tofuzinzin, told us more about you ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">I am Alexandre, aka Tofuzinzin, I play a lot of video games, and I love the idea of creating my own game, it is very exciting !</p>
			<p id="question">So, what is your role in Explosive Rainbow Poop ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">I am the lead artist of the team, reponsible of the cars design. I created almost all the cars in our game, using pre-existing assets from games like
			Jak or Mad Max.</p>
			<p id="question">Oh ! As a lead artist, what are your inspirations ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">I love the Mad Max universe. I played a lot the Mad Max game to catch the atmosphere, and to try to retranscript it in our game. I really love this post
			apocalyptic ambiance. When we talked about the context around our game, we decided to place our game in this post apo area. But we decided not only to show sand maps, 
			with empty landscapes. But we wanted to show various places, such as Aztec montains, destroyed cities, or even unexpected maps, such as small cars maps. We just hope you
			will enjoy this artistic direction !</p>
			<p id="question">What do you prefer in the game</p>
			<p id="reponse">I love the SandShark. It's a long love story : for me, the SandShark is a car from Jak 3, and back in my childhood, I played a lot Jak 3 and Jak X, and those
			games are still today my main inspirations. This car is really beautiful, I love its design.</p>
			<p id="question">One last question : what are your expectations about Vroom Boom ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">I hope Vroom Boom will be a fun game, with a gameplay and many features that will attract players. I also hope of course that we will get a good grade with it.</p>
			<p id="question">A last word for your fans ?</p>
			<p id="reponse">There is no sin but ignorance - All is dust</p>
			<p id="question">Heu... Right...</p>
			
			<p>
			I want to thank Tofuzinzin and Thibthib for their time.
			</br></br>See you soon !</br></br>
