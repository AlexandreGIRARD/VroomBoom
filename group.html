		<p id="presentation_group"><i>Explosive Rainbow Poop</i> is a team of 3 developers from <i>EPITA</i> who wanted to create
	    a fun game they could play together. From that first idea came out a car game, Vroom Boom, as a second semester
		final project. Discover all the members of this incredible team :</p>

				<p>
				My name is <i>Thibaut 'Dark ThibThib' Mattenet</i> and I’m 20 years old. Since i was little I always liked video games. So I’m enjoying doing this project with my friends. I love EDM music (especially from Monstercat label) and i listen to every style of it. If you ever play to our game, it might be felt because we put some EDM tracks. I don’t like much to go out and I prefer staying in my comfort zone.

				<p>
				My name is <i>Alexandre 'Tofuzinzin' Girard</i>, I’m 18 years old. I’m passionate about cycling but especially about mountain biking. I practiced it during 5 years before stopping it for studies.
				Obviously, I’m a huge fan of video games and especially racing games and my experience with racing games helped us during the development of Vroom Boom. I listen a lot of music like nu-metal, house or even rap sometimes.
				I’m accustomed to use Adobe Photoshop, After effect, Premiere pro and Illustrator and that helped us during the creation of the visual identity of Vroom Boom

				<p>
				I am <i>Louis 'LYRO' Dupont</i>, 19 years old, and developer of Explosive Rainbow Poop on the project Vroom Boom.
				I am found of programming, especially web development, which I have done for 8 years now. That was my first step
				into programming, but I wanted to improve and do more of that. That is the main reason I wanted to join EPITA.</br>
				This project, Vroom Boom, is not my first game, but it is the one I am the most proud of. I think we have done a
				pretty good job, each of us and as a team, and I still have a lot of ideas for this project. Stay tunned, there may
				be some content coming after...</p>
